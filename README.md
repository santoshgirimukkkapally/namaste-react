# Getting Started with React App

This Project was Implemented from scratch without using npx create-react-app 

I Have used live Swiggy API for this Project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!


## Learn More

### Code Splitting

Implemented Lazy Loading with Suspense you can find this in App.js

### Styling

Used Tailwind CSS  for Styling App.

Tailwind CSS is basically a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces

### State Managment 

Used Redux Toolkit for state management

The Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. It was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:

"Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
"I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"
"Redux requires too much boilerplate code"

To learn redux-toolkit, check out the [Redux-toolkit documentation](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started).


### Testing App

Used React Testing Library with Jest
